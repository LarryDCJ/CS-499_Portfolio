## Professional Self-Assessment

## Enhanced Artifacts
- [Software Design & Engineering](./enhanced_code/SDE_it245_zoo_auth/SDE.md)
- [Data Structures and Algorithms](./enhanced_code/DSALGO_cs260_binary_search_tree/ADS.md) 
- [Databases](./enhanced_code/DB_cs340_animal_finder/DB.md)

## Tasks 

- [] Your code review
- [] Your enhanced artifact or artifacts
- [] Your narrative or narratives
- [] Professional self-assessment (Note: This will be completed last in the course, but it should be the first thing presented in your ePortfolio and function as a holistic introduction to you, your skills, and your ePortfolio.)

- [] Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science

- [] Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts

- [] Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices (data structures and algorithms)

- [] Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals (software engineering/design/database)

- [] Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources
