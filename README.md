# Larry Cawley - SNHU CS-499

## Professional Self-Assessment


Through the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program at SNHU, from October 2018 to March 2024, I acquired a comprehensive skill set in software engineering, emphasizing programming languages such as C++, Java, and SQL, alongside critical insights into security, teamwork, and stakeholder communication. My ePortfolio is a testament to these capabilities, showcasing my adeptness in navigating the intricacies of software development, from design through implementation.

My engagement in courses like the CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle significantly sharpened my collaborative skills and understanding of agile methodologies despite my little interest in being a manager. I’ve since learned that these aren’t only related to those in leadership positions but also help make individual team members better communicators and teammates in making design decisions. Taking on various roles within agile teams, including scrum master and developer, I learned the importance of teamwork and effective communication with stakeholders for project success. The CS-260 course further deepened my grasp of essential concepts such as data structures and algorithms, underpinning the development of efficient and scalable software solutions. This education laid a strong foundation for approaching software engineering with respect for standards, integrating technical proficiency with strategic collaboration and communication.

Course Outcome 1: Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in computer science

In the CS-340 Animal Finder project, I engaged in an initial video code review session that helped me re-familiarize myself with the application's functionality. I contributed to the code base with well-thought-out, contextual comments, ensuring that the code was functional, readable, and understandable, which is crucial for maintaining and scaling the project. This approach supported informed decision-making among software design stakeholders by clarifying the rationale behind design choices and implementation strategies. Throughout the project, I shared my experiences and best practices for working in collaborative settings, highlighting the importance of open communication, mutual respect, and shared goals in achieving successful outcomes in software development projects.


Course Outcome 2: Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts

In the IT-245 Code Review, I aimed to provide a clear and concise description of the code’s limitations and intentions for the enhancements. The enhanced code demonstrates several best practices, such as utilizing descriptive variable names, employing try-with-resources for efficient resource management, and adopting a more modular code structure for better maintainability. I also included Java docs on public methods for developers. While I haven't explicitly discussed broader communication strategies or personal experiences in this review, I tried to tailor the explanation to a technical audience with a basic understanding of Java programming concepts. Through this approach, I hoped to convey the reasoning for the changes and encourage further discussion and collaboration within the development team.

Course Outcome 3: Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles, computer science practices, and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs in design choices

In refining my CS-260 BST project for managing bid data, I navigated through code complexities, focusing on operations like insertion, search, and deletion, and later incorporated AVL balancing for more efficient performance. This process, aligned with designing and evaluating computing solutions through algorithmic principles and computer science practices, was further advanced by transitioning to CMakeLists, improving scalability and the build process. These steps demonstrated a strategic balance between functionality, performance, and efficiency, highlighting the thoughtful management of design trade-offs. The project deepened my understanding of complex software algorithms and the importance of applying CS standards to solve problems effectively.

Course Outcome 4: Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices to implement computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals

Improvements made to the IT-245 Zoo Authentication project include the streamlined process for verifying credentials and assigning user roles, highlighting innovative techniques in computing practices. These enhancements delivered a more secure and user-friendly authentication system and directly contributed to the goal of safeguarding sensitive information within the zoo's IT infrastructure. This project helps show how standard computing techniques are employed to achieve specific, industry-relevant objectives.

Course Outcome 5: Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.

I made significant security changes while improving the IT-245 Zoo Authentication project. Initially, the system's security practices were basic, with direct file access and rudimentary password management. The updated approach enhances security through MD5 password hashing and streamlined authentication, aligning with contemporary security practices. This change addresses potential vulnerabilities and design flaws and reinforces data privacy and system integrity. By anticipating and mitigating security risks, the project demonstrates a proactive security mindset, emphasizing the importance of validating data and adapting to future technological shifts while reflecting best practices in creating secure, resilient systems.
