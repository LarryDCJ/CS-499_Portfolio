# Binary Search Tree

[Initial Code Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDugSRiZp2w)

## About This Application

The Binary Search Tree (BST) Application is a high-performance, scalable data management system implemented in C++. It leverages AVL tree balancing to maintain O(log n) time complexity for insertions, deletions, and search operations, ensuring optimal efficiency. This project exemplifies best practices in algorithm design and software development, focusing on efficiency, security, and maintainability.

## Setup
### Prerequisites
* C++ Compiler (GCC or Clang)
* CMake

### Building the Project
* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Navigate to the project directory.
* Run cmake . to configure the build system.
* Execute make to compile the project.

### Usage
After building the project, you can run the executable to interact with the BST application. The application allows for the management of data using AVL balanced binary search trees, ensuring efficient processing.
